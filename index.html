              <p> I recently enrolled in Epicodus because I would like to learn more about the field of technology through real world experience. Prior to this transition, I was working towards a Ph.D at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I studied the impacts of social media and other online platforms on both individual sociopolitical activity and organized political action. I also spent that time designing, redesigning, and teaching a core composition and research skills course which priveleged "multimodal" communication (i.e. communications through mediums not traditionally associated with college, like memes, <em>Reddit</em> threads, and video games). In this time, I realized that, even though I truly enjoyed teaching and reseach, I wanted to better understand how these mediums are constructed and utilized--essentially, the content and work hidden from the user.
